# pock

Easy to use HTTP mocking solution, compatible with PSR-18 and HTTPlug. Should resemble [gock](https://github.com/h2non/gock) in the end.

Project in its early development stage. User manual is not there yet, but you can find autogenerated documentation [here](neur0toxine.github.io/pock/).

Most of the desired functionality is already implemented, but the API itself can change over time.
